# Domino-Theory

Based on Domino Theory by Margery Albis in Games: World of Puzzles, February 2020.


The three puzzles in the magazine weren't enough for me, so I made a version in MATLAB to play as much as I want.


# Instructions
  Domino Theory requires you to place 28 unique dominos into the grid. The dominos are all placed vertically and the number on the upper half will always be less than or equal to the number on the lower half of the domino.
  
From the magazine:

  "Your goal is to find each domino's proper place in the grid, using the numbers outside the grid. The four numbers listed above each column indicate the numbers that will go into the top half of each domino in that column. Likewise, the four numbers listed below each column indicate the numbers that will go into the bottom half of each domino in that column."
  
  "The rows work the same way--that is, each row's upper set of seven numbers indicates the numbers that will go into the top half of each domino in that row, the lower set of seven numbers indicates the numbers that will go into the bottom half of each domino in that row."
  
  Left Clicking a grid square will bring up a tool with buttons for each number and an X button to clear the square. Right Clicking will bring up the same tool in Note Mode allowing you to make notes about which number can go in that square. The clues around the grid will automatically dim once they have been fulfilled. If you enter a number that causes a conflict, like having the 2/6 domino twice or placing a 6 in a row that shouldn't have any 6s, the number will turn red as will anything it conflicts with.
